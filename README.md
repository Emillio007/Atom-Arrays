# Atom-Arrays
This repository is the publication of the Atom Array framework built during the research for the Master thesis: "Atomic Light-Matter Interfaces with Controlled Super- &amp; Subradiance". It features highly costumizable diagonalizations of dipole-coupled atomic array systems and time evolution with varying parameters for simulating experiments.

Animations that are referenced in the thesis can be found as appendix in the folder "figures".
