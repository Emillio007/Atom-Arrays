# Atom-Arrays
This repository is the publication of the Atom Array framework built during the research for the Master thesis: "Atomic Light-Matter Interfaces with Controlled Super- &amp; Subradiant Emission". It features highly costumizable diagonalizations of dipole-coupled atomic array systems and time evolution with varying parameters for simulating experiments.

Animations that are referenced in the thesis can be found as appendix in the folder "figures".

Dependencies:
 - NumPy
 - SciPy
 - Matplotlib

In the folder "examples", jupyter notebooks with examples and showcases can be found: 
 - Linear lattice
 - ... More to come: Experiment simulation, custom lattice, tutorial on using Parameter module, showing the tracking algorithms

Documentation is work-in-progress.
