# Atom-Arrays
Welcome to the Atom Arrays framework to characterize and simulate time-evolution of highly super- and subradiant states of a dipole-interacting atomic array. A short introduction to the physics are given in PHYSICS.md. For rigorous derivations, results and figures, please refer to:

Animations that are referenced in the thesis can be found as appendix in the folder "figures".

This repository is the publication of the Atom Array framework built during the research for the Master thesis: "Atomic Light-Matter Interfaces with Controlled Super- &amp; Subradiant Emission". It features highly costumizable diagonalizations of dipole-coupled atomic array systems and time evolution with varying parameters for simulating experiments.
